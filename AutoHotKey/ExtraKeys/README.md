# "Extra Keys" AHK (AutoHotKey) folder

This folder is for *super*-simple always-on AHK scripts, used to augment limited keyboards.

For example, if your keyboard doesn't have an Insert/Home/End key, and you have a specific application or use-case that requires it. These scripts are super-simple shortcuts to activate those keys, and are designed to be always-on.
